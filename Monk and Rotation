# // input().split() gives you idkw but its not a specific thing and its str.
so make it int,or list or whatever you need.
# // x = k%n is used to remove the complete rotations, ie. if i have to rotate [1,2,3] - 4 time, it means i essentially have to rotate it just once.
# // print(*l) prints a list like a str
# // we use n-x and not x . try examples and u'll know why.
